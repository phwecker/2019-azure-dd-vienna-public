## Azure Discovery Day - Vienna (26.3.2019)
The purpose of this repository is to provide the sample code used in the "Modern Applications" session to illustrate how Microsoft Azure can help you in aspiring to the 10 properties of a modern, cloud-native, application. 

You will find a distinct wiki page for each of those properties, illustrating the core of each property and how Microsoft Azure can be used to support or achieve it.

The content will materialize, piece by piece, starting **April 2019**, so depending on when you access this repo it might be complete or still work in progress.
